        CASINO\n\n
        Casino is a card game played by 2 players. One player is the human, and the other player is the computer.\n\n
        The objective of this game is to score the most points by capturing cards.\n\n
        The two players will play a "tournament", consisting of one or more rounds.\n\n
        Each round will consist of the two players playing till all the cards have been captured. The tournament ends when one of the players scores 21 or more points.\n\n
        In this game, Kings are valued at 13, Queens at 12, and Jacks at 11. Other cards are valued at their face value.\n\n
        During her turn, a player plays exactly one card from her hand, in one of three ways:\n
        1. build : build a build, multi build, or extend a build\n
        2. capture : capture loose cards or builds or combination of cards\n
        3. trail : throw a hand card into the loose card pile on the table\n
